# MQtest.io

### [MQtest.io](http://mqtest.io/) is a simple tool to help identify which media queries your device responds to.

This test isn’t about what media queries your device [can or cannot](http://www.jordanm.co.uk/palmreader) see. Instead it shows you which dimensions your device will respond to when using 'width=device-width.' You could think of these measures as the max-widths and max-heights in a stylesheet for the device you are esting.
